## Mojo Team Answers

### Init uninitialized objects in `fn`
This is effectively how the Mojo compiler works internally, and we fudge a couple of things for sake of simplicity of model. For example, the `self` member of a `__del__` destructor is a reference, but it is "magic" in that it is required to be live-in and uninit-out. The self for a memory-only `__init__` has the opposite polarity, being uninit on entry and init on exit.

### Multiple Moves with `^`
The `^` operator kills a lifetime or invokes the stealing moveinit, producing a new owned RValue, so `^^^` is just repeatedly moving 🙂. It is probably a noop in the implementation because we do move elision, I haven't checked though.

### Docs Internationalization
We have no plans to translate our content at this time or in the near future. Our products and documentation are still in their infancy and there's a long way to go before curated translation becomes a priority.

### String UInt8 implementation
It makes sense to use `UInt8` instead of `Int8`, although users should not be working directly with the bytes within a string 😀. Also, we try to match C semantics here which uses `char *` for strings. There is a plan to perform optimizations on strings for example small string optimizations, so you should never depend on its layout.
